## Technical Details

MiniPyEngine uses modern OpenGL with custom GLSL shaders for advanced graphics beyond the fixed-function pipeline.  
Shaders are loaded and compiled at runtime from the `shaders/` directory.
To create your own game, simply modify `Player.py`, add your object files (`.obj`, `.mtl`, and textures), and define your objects inside the `objects` folder.
